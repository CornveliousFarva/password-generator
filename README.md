Secure password generator using JavaScript

# Problem this is trying to solve
In today's world, password security is critical. In order to stay ahead of potential security threats, keeping passwords secure and random is one of the first things anyone can do to prevent their data from being stolen and put on the black market.

# Structure of the app
This contains a basic HTML and CSS files and a script JS file that runs the program.

# How to use the app
1. Select the password length, ranging from 4 to 128.
2. The user can choose the following to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers. The more selected, the more will be included when the password is generated.
3. After making the selections, click "Generate Password."

5. In order to use it to generate a PIN, select only "include numbers," select the amount of numbers needed and click "Generate Password."

# History
Originally, I had gone with a password generator using a slider to allow users to pick the length based on that. However, I revised it to allow it to be more selective, giving the user to choose whether to use different sizes of letters, symbols, or letters

# Future Add-Ons
1. Adding a back-end to keep a history of passwords and PIN's generated.
2. Letting users keep track of their passwords and be able to pull them up with a custom name.
